# 1. explain your understanding what is the difference between Jenkins SCM option or checking out code using git clone command?
      In git clone command:
            * it's just like normal shell command in jenkins executed using execute shell option.
            * No change history is maintained by jenkins
            * No revision number generated by jenkins, no rollover is possible.


# 1. Get code as soon as someone commits his/her code in repository

      solution one -- via scm polling ##done
      solution two -- via webhook triger ## need to check

# 2. Create a Jenkins job that will take a Git URL & a branch name as an input and clone the code and print the name of file having maximum size

##solution
cd $WORKSPACE
git checkout $Branch
- command 1
  du -a $WORKSPACE | sort -n -r | head -n 1 ##Will include hidden files also
- command 2
  find . -type f -printf "%s %p\n" | sort -nr | head -1|numfmt --to=si ##will include hidden files also
- command 3
  find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -printf "%s %p\n" | sort -nr | head -1|numfmt --to=si
  output : 94K ./EmployeeAutomation/test-output/jquery-1.7.1.min.js

# 3. Create a Jenkins job that will checkout the code, If there is a new change it should invoke other jenkins job that will compile the code. If code compilation is successful next job should get triggered that will generate the artefact. Finally a mail should be sent to you with the name of artefact

##Solution
    job 1 -- for git checkout
    job 2 -- for compile the code
    job 3 -- for artifact generation(packaging) and sending mail
Note: all the 3 jobs should have same workspace using external worksapce feature in jenkins

- Also can we have a visualisation of same?
  # Visualization can be done by using Build pipline plugin of jenkins.
  
# 4. Create a jenkins job that will take username & password and a SQl file as an input. Then it should execute that SQL file in the database.

     - Create a parameterized job that Will accept:
                    username
                    password
                    and a sql file as input
        then execute the SQL file in database
