**List** is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
**Tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
**Set** is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
**Dictionary** is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
