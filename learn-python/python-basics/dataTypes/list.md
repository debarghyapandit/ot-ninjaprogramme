# Python Basics : Data Types (List)

Theory Assignment: Read about Lists and its built-in functions.

**List**

A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.

```python

fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruit_list)

```

**Accessing items in List**

List items can be accessed by referring to the index number:

```python

fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruit_list[1])

```

**Change item value in list**

To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number and update the value:

```python

fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruit_list[1] = "mango"
print(fruit_list)

```

**Looping Through a List**
We can loop through the list items by using a for loop:

```python
fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
  print(x)
```
