Python Basics : Data Types (Tuples)

Theory Assignment: Read about tuples and its built-in functions provided by python.

Tuples-> Tuples is similar to Python lists. Tuples are another standard data type that allows you to store values in a sequence. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified. They might be useful in situations where you might want to share the data with someone but not allow them to manipulate the data. They can, however, use the data values, but no change is reflected in the original data shared. Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than list as it cannot change dynamically.

-> It is defined within parentheses () where items are separated by commas.

-> example: "t = (4, 5, 'hemant', 5+4j)"
-> t[0] = 10  (Gives error becoz Tuples are immutable)
