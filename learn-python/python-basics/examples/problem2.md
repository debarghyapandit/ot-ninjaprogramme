Python Problems:

Assignment_02: Write a script which will implement Jinja templating.

Example:
Create a boto script for listing out all the unused elastic IPs and generate the result in html form so that we can view data on browser.

Note: Do not import any-inbuilt module for generating report in HTML form. Create a Dynamic HTML template using Jinja2 and then use that template to generate the report in HTML form.
